# Getters

Here is a collection of useful getter methods for entities by primary identifiers. Getters mostly deal with retrieving entities by primary keys instead of finders which rely on criteria operations. You can use the `get()` for a single entity, `getOrFail()` for throwing exceptions if an entity is not found and `getAll()` for multiple entities.
